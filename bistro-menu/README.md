# David Chu's China Bistro

Site is live here https://nford88.github.io/web_design_repo/bistro-menu/index.html

David Chuâ€™s China Bistro was a website I created from a design brief on my course. It was one of the first ever projects. It is fully responsive designed website using the Bootstrap.js, HTML and CSS.

It uses AJAX to query a JSON file which has all the menu categories and meals available as to make the UX as smooth as possible, particularly for mobile users. JSON was chosen for speed of rendering as the menu and prices stay the same. Had their been Daily Specials or a rotating menu then I might have thought about the use of a content management system so that the owner could easily edit dishes without the need for any coding knowledge. This might be useful if there is a redesign of the website in the future.
